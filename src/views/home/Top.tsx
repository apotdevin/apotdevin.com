          I'm a <b>Web Developer</b> with great interest in Bitcoin currently
          living in Germany. I'm from Bogotá, Colombia, or how they like to call
          us back home: Un Rolo. I'm a recent joiner to the <b>React </b>
          community with 3 years as a professional React developer, and have
          loved it ever since. I'm currently living in the beautiful city of
          Munich and work as a frontend dev at an e-commerce.

          Apart from my full-time job, my focus is towards developing
          applications on top of the <b>Lightning Network </b>
          <Emoji label={'lightning'} symbol={'⚡'} />, a second layer payment
          solution for Bitcoin. As an innovative new tech, I know this digital
          currency will <b>disrupt</b> the current financial sector at a global
          scale thus find it extremely important to start building solutions on
          top of it.
